/*! \class Bookmarks
 * \brief A proxy class that helps to connect scene graph camera positions
 * (in format eye, center, up and name) with the corresponding BookmarkWidget.
 *
 * The need for the class to inherit osg::Group class is so that to include the
 * bookmarks into saving to file procedure which is done by OpenSceneGraph.
 *
 * Scene graph wise, the entity::Bookmarks is an osg::Group node that contains STL data for camera
 * positions and names. Also
 * osg::Group helps to maintain the entity::SceneState as its children for each corresponding
 * bookmark without the need of direct serialization of each scene state.
 *
 * The need to inherit QObject class is so that to use signals and slots functionality.
 * The signals and slots are connected to the BookmarkWidget and thus it assures
 * a simultaneous update whether the bookmark changed are made directly from the widget,
 * or trigerred by scene graph functions (e.g., on reload the scene from file).
 *
 * Note: there can only be one entity::Bookmarks object in a scene graph, a child of entity::UserScene. This
 * class servers as a container for a list of entity::SceneState -s and a list of camera parameters for each
 * scene state.
