# Polygons

You can insert polygons onto your canvases using the "Draw polygon" tool. Once you click the tool, a pop-up menu will appear allowing you to select the color of your polygon:

![5.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/5.0 choose color.PNG "Choose polygon color")
{: .align-center}

Once you have selected your color, click "Cancel" and draw your polygon by clicking the vertices of your desired polygon, with the first vertex being the same as the last vertex:

![5.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/5.1 draw polygon.gif "Draw polygon")
{: .align-center}
