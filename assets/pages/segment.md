# Lines segments

You can also draw lines segments using the "Draw line segment" tool. To draw a line segment, select the tool, and then on the canvas select the two end points:

![3.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/3.1 draw lines.gif "Draw lines")
{: .align-center}

In the above example, we used the "Draw line segment" tool to draw 3 lines to form a triangle. 

Furthermore, you can also hold the "Shift" key to draw a perfectly horizontal or vertical line:

![3.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/3.2 draw straight lines.gif "Draw straight lines")
{: .align-center}
