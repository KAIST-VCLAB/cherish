# GUI overview

## Canvas Widget
{: .left}

Canvasses are the 3D planes that make up your sketch. The Canvas Widget allows you to navigate between canvasses by simply clicking on the name of the canvas in the widget. Note that the current canvas is depicted with a pink outline and the previous canvas is depicted with an indigo outline:

![0.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/0.0 canvas widget change canvas.gif "Canvas widget change canvas")
{: .align-center}

You can also use the Canvas Widget to rename your canvasses. Simply double-click on the name of the canvas that you want to rename:

![0.0.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/0.0.1 rename canvas.gif "Rename canvas")
{: .align-center}

Furthermore, you can use the Canvas Widget to hide/unhide canvasses by clicking on the eye icon next to each canvas:

![0.0.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/0.0.2 hide unhide canvas.gif "Hide unhide canvas")
{: .align-center}

In addition, you can delete a canvas on the Canvas Widget by clicking the trash icon next to a canvas:

![0.0.3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/0.0.3 delete canvas.gif "Delete canvas")
{: .align-center}

Finally, the Canvas Widget allows you to manage the images on each canvas. Click the dropdown arrow next to each canvas to show the photos on that canvas. You can then delete or rename the photos, or use the + and - icons to adjust the transparency of the image:

![0.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/0.1 image navigation, transparency.gif "Image transparency")
{: .align-center}

## Bookmark Widget
{: .left}

Bookmarks are camera locations that you have saved. Simply clicking on a bookmark in the Bookmark Widget will change the camera view to the saved view:

![0.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/0.2 bookmarks widget.gif "Bookmark widget")
{: .align-center}

## Photobase Widget
{: .left}

The Photobase Widget contains all of the images in your photobase directory:

![0.3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/0.3 photobase widget.gif "Photobase widget")
{: .align-center}

You can insert photos from the Photobase Widget onto your canvasses. 

## Camera Panel
{: .left}

The Camera Panel allows you to interact with different camera views. For instance, the "Previous view" and "Next view" tools allow you to cycle between your most recently used camera views:

![0.4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/0.4 camera widget previous next.gif "Previous, next")
{: .align-center}

In addition, the "Look at canvas" tool will automatically change the camera view to a view that is looking directly at your current canvas:

![0.4.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/0.4.1 Look at canvas.gif "Look at canvas")
{: .align-center}

In the above example, we set the current canvas to be "maps" and the "Look at canvas" tool provided us with a view that allowed us to see the entire "maps" canvas.

Furthermore, the Camera Panel also contains the "Camera settings" tool which allows you to adjust the Field of View (FOV):

![0.4.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/0.4.2 camera settings.PNG "Camera setings")
{: .align-center}

The tools for creating bookmarks will be discussed in the "Bookmarks" section of this guide. 



## Model export
{: .left}

You can export your sketches as 3D object files. To do this go to "File"->"Export as...". Save the name of your file with the ".obj" extension:

![0.6]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/0.6 export.PNG "Export model")
{: .align-center}


<!-- Include: canvas widget, photo transparency management, bookmark widget, photobase widget, model export, camera panel, file panel, etc. -->

### Defining new canvases
{: .left}

Canvases are the 3D planes that users can sketch on. To define a new canvas, use one of the tools in the "New Canvas" tool:

![1.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/1.1 ground plane.PNG "New Canvas menu")
{: .align-center}

The four basic definiton tools "Ground plane", "Left plane", "Right plane", and "Front plane" simply define a new plane matching the given description. For example, defining a "Ground plane" will create a plane corresponding to the ground plane, or XY plane:

![1.11]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/1.1 ground plane creation.gif "Ground plane")
{: .align-center}

Similarly, defining a "Left plane" will define a plane on the left:

![1.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/1.2 left plane.PNG "Left plane")
{: .align-center}

In addition, there are several more advanced tools for defining a new plane. For instance, the "Clone Current" tool will create a copy of the current plane you are working with:

![1.3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/1.3 clone current.gif "Clone Current")
{: .align-center}

Finally, you can use the "New Canvas Set" tool to create a "Standard" set of three canvases consisting of one Ground Plane, one Left Plane, and one Front Plane:

![1.4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/1.4 new canvas set.PNG "New Canvas Set")
{: .align-center}

![1.41]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/1.41 new canvas setted.PNG "New Canvas Setted")
{: .align-center}


### Interacting with canvases
{: .left}

Once you have defined canvases, there are several tools that you can use to interact with your canvases. 

First of all, it is important to note that you only work with one canvas at a time. To change the canvas that you are currently working on, you can use the "Select canvas" tool. For instance, if we wanted to sketch on one canvas and then another, we would have to use the "Select canvas" tool to change the current canvas:

![1.5]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/1.5 change canvas.gif "Change Canvas")
{: .align-center}

In the above example, we first sketched a circle on Canvas 2, and then changed canvases to Canvas 1, where we sketched an X. Also, as mentioned earlier, another way to navigate between canvasses is to use the canvas widget on the right side of the display. 

Furthermore, the "Edit canvas location" tool allows you change the the 3D location of your canvas. You can use the tool to rotate and offset the current canvas:

![1.6]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/1.6 edit location.gif "Edit canvas location")
{: .align-center}

<!-- Include: definition, tools description (non-selected vs. selected), manipulation (rotation and offset). -->

## Strokes
{: .left}

You can sketch on your canvases by drawing strokes. It is easy to draw a stroke, simply select the "Sketch" tool, and draw on your current canvas:

![2.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/2.1 sketch.gif "Sketch")
{: .align-center}

There are a couple ways you can delete your strokes. One way is to select the "Deleter" tool and click on your stroke:

![2.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/2.2 erase.gif "Delete")
{: .align-center}

In addition, the "Select 2D entity" tool is a very useful tool for interacting with your strokes. First of all, you can use the tool to select your strokes. Once you have selcted your strokes, then you will be able to scale, drag, and rotate your strokes:

![2.3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/2.3 select, scale, drag, 2D rotate.gif "Select, scale, drag, 2D rotate")
{: .align-center}

Furthermore, you can delete your selected strokes using the "Backspace" key:

![2.31]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/2.31 select delete.gif "Select, delete")
{: .align-center}

Finally, you can "Cut" (CTRL+X), "Copy" (CTRL+C), and "Paste" (CTRL+V) your selected strokes using the appropriate tools or shortcuts:

![2.32]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/2.32 select copy paste.gif "Select, copy, paste")
{: .align-center}


<!-- Include: how to draw a stroke, delete it, select it, copy-paste, scale, 2d rotate.
 -->

## Lines segments
{: .left}

You can also draw lines segments using the "Draw line segment" tool. To draw a line segment, select the tool, and then on the canvas select the two end points:

![3.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/3.1 draw lines.gif "Draw lines")
{: .align-center}

In the above example, we used the "Draw line segment" tool to draw 3 lines to form a triangle. 

Furthermore, you can also hold the "Shift" key to draw a perfectly horizontal or vertical line:

![3.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/3.2 draw straight lines.gif "Draw straight lines")
{: .align-center}



## Photographs
{: .left}

You can insert images onto your canvases using the Photo Widget. First, however, you need to choose the folder that contains your images. Select the "Choose folder with photo base" tool:

![4.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/4.0 choose photo base.PNG "Choose photo base")
{: .align-center}

Then navigate to the folder which contains your photo base:

![4.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/4.1 choose directory.PNG "Choose directory")
{: .align-center}

At this point, the photo widget will be populated with the photos in your photo base folder. Note that currently the only image type that works is ".bmp" files. To insert a photo onto your current canvas, drag the photo from the photo widget onto the canvas:

![4.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/4.2 insert photo.gif "Insert photo")
{: .align-center}

You can interact with the photo using the "Select 2D entity" tool. When you have selected the image, you can resize it, drag it, and rotate it:

![4.3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/4.3 resize, drag, rotate.gif "Resize, drag, rotate photo")
{: .align-center}

You can also delete a photo by selecting it and hitting "Backspace":

![4.4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/4.4 select delete photo.gif "Select delete photo")
{: .align-center}


<!-- Include: size change. -->

## Polygons
{: .left}

You can insert polygons onto your canvases using the "Draw polygon" tool. Once you click the tool, a pop-up menu will appear allowing you to select the color of your polygon:

![5.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/5.0 choose color.PNG "Choose polygon color")
{: .align-center}

Once you have selected your color, click "Cancel" and draw your polygon by clicking the vertices of your desired polygon, with the first vertex being the same as the last vertex:

![5.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/5.1 draw polygon.gif "Draw polygon")
{: .align-center}

## Bookmarks
{: .left}

Bookmarks are camera views that you have saved. There are two ways to create a new bookmark. The first is to use the "Bookmark view" tool on the Camera Panel. This will save your current view as a new bookmark:

![6.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/6.0 bookmarks widget, bookmark view.gif "Bookmark view")
{: .align-center}

In addition, you can use the "Position new bookmark" tool to define a new bookmark of a camera view that you can manually position yourself. Before using this tool, first select the canvas on which your desired camera location is located. Then, click the "Position new bookmark" tool, and then choose the camera location, view direction, and field of view:

![6.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/6.1 position new bookmark.gif "Position new bookmark")
{: .align-center}

When you create a new bookmark and view this way, you are given the option to create a new canvas associated with the new view. This is a great way to create the canvas on which you may want to place your images:

![6.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/user_guide/6.2 new canvas with view.PNG "Associated canvas")
{: .align-center}

<!-- Include: definition, where to find them, how to take them (2 different ways). -->
