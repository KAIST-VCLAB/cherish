**Cherish** is a tool that aids archaeologists and designers to represent historical, urban and archaeological structures and sites in 3D by means of image manipulation and sketching. **Cherish** creation was inspired by the [Yale's Dura Europos dataset](http://media.artgallery.yale.edu/duraeuropos/) - a large image dataset of an ancient site which is located in modern Syria. One of the main characteristic of the data set is its spacial sparsity and featureless natures of photographs which does not allow us to utilize modern computer vision in order to obtain 3D representation of the site.

The figure above contains a photo sample of the dataset. Note the featureless nature of the presented textures - combined with sparse sampling of the site, we cannot simply feed the dataset to the method like bundle adjustment.

The main idea behind **Cherish** is to use the knowledge and expertise of a specialist in order to perform semi-manual data organization. Therefore, given a problem of disparate data types such as photographs, illustrations, diagrams, text annotations, point cloud representation, etc., **Cherish** aims to provide a tool to combine all the above data into a comprehensive 3D space, i.e., *to make 3D sense of the data*.
